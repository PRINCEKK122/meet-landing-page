## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Box Model
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I challenged myself to use SASS for this project. The resource that I used to help me get the job done was Brad Travery's [HTML and CSS From the Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-html-css-from-the-beginning/). I am not affiliated to this course in anyways, but I believe it is one of the best resources out there to get you up to speed.

### Continued development
Henceforth, I will be using SASS to complete most of the front-end mentor challenges, together with the React Framework.
